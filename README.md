this is a list with my projects since they don't all fit in my pins. they're all made to be used with active pogo scanning/mapping setups but some work standalone.

My Discord is @Malte#4444 (211562278800195584)

[pogodata](https://github.com/ccev/pogodata) - a very cool py module you can use to handle all kinds of pogo objects

[pogoinfo](https://github.com/ccev/pogoinfo) - an "api" (but ghetto) providing updated info about pogo events, nests, grunts and whatever else there is

[tileserver-middleman](https://github.com/ccev/tileserver-middleman) - a middleman you can use to host swifttileservercache static maps on discord and show surrounding stops/gyms on them
